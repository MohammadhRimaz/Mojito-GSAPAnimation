# üç∏ Velvet Pour ‚Äì A Bar Landing Page Scroll Animation Website

Welcome to the Velvet Pour ‚Äì a creative and immersive one-page website designed and developed using **React** and **Vite**. This project was crafted as part of my web development learning journey, with a focus on exploring scroll-based animations, visual storytelling, and video-to-frame animations using **GSAP** and **FFmpeg**.

- **Hero Section with Mojito Scroll Effect**: As users scroll, a mojito drink is animated into view, followed by a falling ice cube video synced with scroll.
- **FFmpeg Frame-by-Frame Video Scroll**: Ice cube fall rendered using video frames for buttery-smooth performance.
- **Masked Image Animations**: Stylish image reveals and transitions using CSS masks and JavaScript.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices.
- **Five Interactive Sections**:

## üß† Learning Process / Ideology

This project served as a hands-on dive into animation-heavy UI development. My focus was on:

- Exploring **GSAP‚Äôs** scroll-based animation toolkit.
- Using **FFmpeg** to convert a falling ice cube video into frames to simulate real-time interaction with the drink.
- Practicing **clean UI layout** and **creative transitions** to enhance user engagement.
- Gaining confidence in **video manipulation**, **SVG masking**, and **advanced CSS** techniques.

The goal was not only to build a visually appealing site but also to test and push the boundaries of what could be achieved with frontend animation tools in a performant, creative way.
